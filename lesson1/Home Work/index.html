                    Simpsons
                    and part of the Simpson family. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in
                    The
                    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and
                    designed
                    Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a
                    series
                    of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of
                    characters.
                    While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an
                    anagram
                    of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for two years, the Simpson family
                    received
                    its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode
                    except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".
